# Content: Procfile for PostgreSQL
🔹 1. Check if the server is running
Run this in your terminal:



# pg_ctl -D C:\pgdata status
If it says "server is not running", then you need to start it:



# pg_ctl -D C:\pgdata -l logfile start
You should see:
waiting for server to start.... done
server started

🔹 2. Confirm it's listening on port 5432
Once started, confirm that PostgreSQL is accepting connections:
# netstat -an | find "5432"
You should see something like:

nginx

TCP    127.0.0.1:5432     LISTENING


🔹 3. Connect to default DB with current user
Try connecting again:
# psql -U Dhurkesh -d postgres

If that works: 🎉
Then create the postgres superuser and the expense_db database.

🚨 Still Not Working?
If the above fails, here are fallback checks:

✔️ Check if pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf allow connections
C:\pgdata\postgresql.conf:

ini

listen_addresses = 'localhost'
port = 5432
C:\pgdata\pg_hba.conf:
Make sure it has:

sql

local   all             all                                     trust
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
After editing either file, restart PostgreSQL:



# pg_ctl -D C:\pgdata restart


# Reset all migration history
rm -rf migrations/
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
